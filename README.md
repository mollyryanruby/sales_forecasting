# 5 Machine Learning Techniques for Forecasting Sales 

## Objective: 
Predict the number of monthly product sales using regressive and time-series modeling techniques

## Featured Techniques:
* EDA
* Linear Regression
* Random Forest Regression
* XGBoost
* Long Short Term Memory (artifical recurrent neural network)
* ARIMA Time Series Forecasting

## Results:
* Best results were obtained from the XGBoost and LSTM models
* All models predicted within 2% of monthly mean sales for 12 month prediction
